# TESTS.md

Ways to test and verify WorldEditor that are known to work. Read this before working out how to check
a change, and add to it when you find a good way to test something (see CLAUDE.md).

Each entry says what it checks, how to run it, and the traps that cost time.

## Unit and integration tests

- `make test` runs `go test ./internal/...` and the frontend unit tests (`node --test`, Node 22.18+).
- `make check` runs go vet and svelte-check/tsc.
- WoW client integration tests: `WOW_DIR=/path/to/client go test ./internal/wow/ -v`.

## Rendering and UI in the live app (Claude in Chrome)

Checks: anything visual (shaders, shadows, lighting, models, UI) against the real client assets.

- `make dev` (`wails dev`) serves the app at http://localhost:34115. The page exposes
  `window.__engine` (the Engine), `window.__loadScene(text)` and `window.__sceneText()`.
- Open a known spot with a scene: `{map:{region:{mapName:'Azeroth',x:32,y:48,size:1}}}` opens
  Northshire (the abbey is at about world x 182, z 353; the valley is dense canopy, so most ground
  is in tree shadow).
- Traps:
  - Tabs opened by the Chrome extension are usually `document.hidden`, so the rAF loop stops (the
    frame counter is stuck and loads hang). Drive frames with `__engine.frame()` from
    `javascript_tool`, then take the screenshot.
  - `javascript_tool` results that contain shader source are blocked as "cookie/query data".
    `console.log` them and read them with `read_console_messages` and a pattern.
  - If `/wow/status` gives no response, the Go side of the user's `wails dev` has died (its Vite
    child lingers on port 5391 and blocks a new `wails dev`). Tell the user their dev session is
    gone before starting one.
  - Vite's watcher misses files replaced by rename, such as by `sed -i` (and maybe Wails' binding
    regeneration). Vite then serves the stale module and the page fails with "does not provide an
    export named …". Edit with the Edit tool or an in-place write, and re-save a missed file in
    place to fix it. Check what is served through the Wails proxy, `curl localhost:34115/<file>`:
    Vite's own port moves (5173, 5174…), and an old dead Vite can linger on 5173.
  - `make build-windows` while `wails dev` runs is fine.
  - To call app modules (e.g. `selectSpawn`, `editor`) from `javascript_tool`, import the exact
    URL the page loaded (from `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')`, with its `?t=`). A bare
    path gives a second module instance with separate state.
- Off-screen probes settle what screenshots can't: read back a depth texture, or render from the
  sun's view and draw it onto a page overlay. This is how a "shadows look broken" report was
  traced to the shadow setup rather than the pipeline.
- three r186 facts that matter when reading shader output: `PCFSoftShadowMap` is removed (falls
  back to PCF), shadow maps are depth textures, and inside `#pragma unroll_loop` only
  `UNROLLED_LOOP_INDEX` and `[ i ]` are substituted.

## Scripted brush strokes

Checks: what a sculpt mode does to the heights, without dragging the mouse. In the dev page
(`javascript_tool`), make a flat map and drive the tool directly:

```js
const e = window.__engine
const ed = (await import(performance.getEntriesByType('resource').map(r => r.name).find(n => n.includes('editor.svelte.ts')))).editor
e.newDocument(256, 'flat', 0, 'Brushes')
ed.tool = 'sculpt'; e.frame()                 // frame() activates the tool
ed.sculptMode = 'crevice'; ed.brush.radius = 14; ed.brush.strength = 1
const V3 = e.controller.target.constructor    // THREE.Vector3
const at = (x, z) => new V3(x, e.terrain.heightAt(x, z), z)
e.tools.sculpt.onDown(e.ctx, at(60, 300))
for (let i = 0; i < 120; i++) e.tools.sculpt.tick(e.ctx, 0.05, at(60 + i * 2, 300))
e.tools.sculpt.onUp(e.ctx)                    // pushes the undo step
e.controller.target.set(180, 0, 300); e.controller.distance = 120; for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) e.frame()
e.terrain.heightAt(180, 300)                  // then screenshot
```

- `tick(dt)` scales by `dt`, so a fast scripted drag digs as little as a fast real one.
- `e.history.undo()` then `e.frame()` checks the stroke's undo.

## Reproducing a user's view

- A pasted `WorldEditor scene {...}` line (Help > Copy Scene) loads with
  `await window.__loadScene(text)` in the dev page. Loading sets the view prefs, which are saved to
  the user's config.
- Hold F8 in the app to name the component under the cursor (`DebugOverlay.svelte`).
